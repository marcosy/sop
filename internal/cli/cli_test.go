Usage:	sop [options] <operation> <filepath A> <filepath B>

operation:
  union
	Print elements that are in file A or file B
  intersection
	Print elements that are in file A and file B
  difference
	Print elements of file A that do not exist in file B

options:

Examples:
  sop union fileA.txt fileB.txt
  sop -s "," union fileA.csv fileB.csv
